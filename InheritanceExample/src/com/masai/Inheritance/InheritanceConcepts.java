/**
 * If we want a mechanism in which what ever code I am writing in one class(super class) it should 
 * be available for the some other classes also without writing any extra syntax or anything else 
 * here concept of inheritance comes into the picture.  
 * Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquire the property of of another object.
 * What ever be written in the superType is automatically applicable for subType such that no need to write down again
 * Inheritance provides re-usability
 * if we adding or removing some operations from the superclass then that operation will be added or removed from the subclasses as well.
 * In Inheritance whatever you are written in the superclass is available for all subclasses but if whatever you are writing in 
 * the subclasses it will not available in superclass so vice versa is not true. Inheritance is completely unidirectional
 * In java Programming single and hirerchial level of inheritance is supported. But multiple Inheritance is not possible or supported.
 * It is wrong that private methods are not inheritate.It is inheritate but not accessible out of the class.
 * Whatever br written in the superclass it will be inherited to subclass but the only thing that constructor is not inherited to subclass.
 * private variable accessible only to their own class.
